=head1 Name

ngx.resp - Lua API for HTTP response handling.


=head1 Status

This Lua module is currently considered experimental.


=head1 Synopsis


    local ngx_resp = require "ngx.resp"
    
    -- add_header
    ngx_resp.add_header("Foo", "bar")
    ngx_resp.add_header("Foo", "baz")
    --> there will be two new headers in HTTP response:
    --> Foo: bar and Foo: baz




=head1 Description

This Lua module provides Lua API which could be used to handle HTTP response.




=head1 Methods

All the methods of this module are static (or module-level). That is, you do
not need an object (or instance) to call these methods.




=head2 add_header

B<syntax:> I<ngx_resp.add_header(header_name, header_value)>

This function adds specified header with corresponding value to the response of
current request. The C<header_value> could be either a string or a table.

The C<ngx.resp.add_header> works mostly like:

=over


=item *

L<ngx.header.HEADER|https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxheaderheader>

=item *

Nginx's L<add_header|http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header> directive.


=back

However, unlike C<ngx.header.HEADER>, this method appends new header to the old
one instead of overriding it.

Unlike C<add_header> directive, this method will override the builtin header
instead of appending it.
